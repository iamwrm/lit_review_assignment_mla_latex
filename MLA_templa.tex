%Introduction
Williams states the dominate status of communicaiton in sale industry through
``The industrial salesperson's most basic activity during the exchange is
communication''(Williams 29) 

%Phutela states that non-verbal communication is defined as a silent form of
%communicating with a person or party without any form of speech and in many
%cases non-verbal communication have greater effects than verbal communication.
%For non-verbal rules differ according to the situations and people, it
%can also become obstacle to effective communication.
%When verbal and non-verbal communication conflicts, people tend to believe in
%non-verbal communication.
%Phutela classifies non-verbal communication into four categories and they are
%aesthetic communication, physical communication, signs and symbols of
%communication.
%Phutela regards physical communication as the most used type of communication,
%including distance, facial expression, gesture and eye contact.
%Then the author provides that non-verbal communication’s effect is to repeat,
%check substitute people’s message.
%To be more persuasive, Phutela inserts a diagram indicating the enormous amount
%of body language making an impression.
%After that, Phutela emphasizes the importance of non-verbal communication at
%workplace by give examples like handshake, eye contact and dressing.
%After listing tips and abilities for non-verbal communication by two tables,
%Phutela leads to a conclusion.
%For non-verbal communication is in various forms, an effective one needs the
%receiver’s competent interpretation ability, thus acquiring time and practice.
