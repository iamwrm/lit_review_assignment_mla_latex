%Introduction
% Attention grabber
Williams states the dominate status of communicaiton in sale industry through
``The industrial salesperson's most basic activity during the exchange is
communication''(Williams, 29) Winter provides that ``men and women exhibit
different leadership styles and interpersonal communication styles in a variety
of small group situations from student problem-solving situations to industry
and community situations''(Winter, 44), indicating that the property of communicating
differs within different contexts.
Since communication is so significant in business, especially in service
situations, the nature and  properties of communication worth investigating in detail.
% The definition of communication
Communication can be defined as the imparting or exchanging of information or news.
% communication in service
In service industry, communicaiton means that the service provieders receice the
information from the customers about what service they want, either a physical
service like a specfic type of coffee or a virtual one like a overall message.
If there is a barrier between the service providers and customers about the real
needs of the the customers and what this company provides at that time, the
business won't be able to proceed and both sides can't get what they want. Every
company definitely wants to avoid such a lose-lose situation for such a
situation will not only lose money because the service is not undergoing, but
also will suffer a bad reputation for the customers may be disappointed or even
angry about that unsuccessful communicaiton and then tell others not to use the
service from this company.



%Phutela states that non-verbal communication is defined as a silent form of
%communicating with a person or party without any form of speech and in many
%cases non-verbal communication have greater effects than verbal communication.
%For non-verbal rules differ according to the situations and people, it
%can also become obstacle to effective communication.
%When verbal and non-verbal communication conflicts, people tend to believe in
%non-verbal communication.
%Phutela classifies non-verbal communication into four categories and they are
%aesthetic communication, physical communication, signs and symbols of
%communication.
%Phutela regards physical communication as the most used type of communication,
%including distance, facial expression, gesture and eye contact.
%Then the author provides that non-verbal communication’s effect is to repeat,
%check substitute people’s message.
%To be more persuasive, Phutela inserts a diagram indicating the enormous amount
%of body language making an impression.
%After that, Phutela emphasizes the importance of non-verbal communication at
%workplace by give examples like handshake, eye contact and dressing.
%After listing tips and abilities for non-verbal communication by two tables,
%Phutela leads to a conclusion.
%For non-verbal communication is in various forms, an effective one needs the
%receiver’s competent interpretation ability, thus acquiring time and practice.
