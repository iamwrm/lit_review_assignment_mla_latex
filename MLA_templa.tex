%-----Introduction
% Attention grabber
Williams states the dominate status of communication in sale industry through
``The industrial salesperson's most basic activity during the exchange is
communication''(Williams, 29). Winter provides that ``men and women exhibit
different leadership styles and interpersonal communication styles in a variety
of small group situations from student problem-solving situations to industry
and community situations''(Winter, 44), indicating that the property of communicating
differs within different contexts.
Since communication is so significant in business, especially in service
situations, the nature and properties of communication worth investigating in detail.
% The definition of communication
Communication can be defined as the imparting or exchanging of information or news.
% verbal and nonverbal
Communication can be classified into verbal one and nonverbal one. Verbal
communication means the exchange of information in speaking of notes passing and
nonverbal communication means the process without spoken or written words. In
fact, it is suggested that ``Nonverbal communication accounts for nearly 70 percent
of all communication ''(Barnum and Wolniansky, 1989).
% communication in service
In service industry, communication means that the service providers receive the
information from the customers about what service they want, either a physical
service like a specific type of coffee or a virtual one like a overall message.
In service industry, or to be clearer, a coffee shop the social interaction in
verbal communication is that the barista provides what coffee this shop has and
customers state what they want. The social interaction in nonverbal
communication is that the barista should talk with a smile and make
coffee with enthusiasm so that the customers will be comfortable to pay for the
service they have ordered.
% consequence
If there is a barrier between the service providers and customers about the real
needs of the customers and what this company provides at that time, the
business won't be able to proceed and both sides can't get what they want. Every
company wants to avoid such a lose-lose situation for such a situation will not
only lose money because the service is not undergoing, but also, the company
will suffer a bad reputation for the customers may be disappointed or even angry
about that unsuccessful communication and then tell others not to use the
service from this company.
Without communication, every person is isolated, and one individual's ability
can't make enormous achievements. In addition, by false communication, people
may misunderstand each other, thus becoming isolated or even hostile.

%-----Body      three articles

% art one
Sundaram states the importance of communication for service encounters.
The paper devotes in improving the nonverbal communication in order to improve
customers' evaluation on employees, furthermore expanding business profits. 
The way of communicating information without words is in greatest amount of all
communication. Service employees' nonverbal behaviors contributes a lot to
customers' perceptions of communicators' credibility. Sundaram groups nonverbal
communication into four categories: paralanguage, kinetics, proxemics and
physical appearance. The author then develops a ``conceptional model'' to
explain the mechanism of how nonverbal communication affects customers'
evaluation. Sundaram shows that pleasing nonverbal cues producing positive
affect will result in enouraging customer to connect positive characteristics
with service providers, and vice versa. Though Sundaram clearly indicates 
nonverbal communication's affection on the business, the author lacks a detailed
analysis on nonverbal cues itself. Phutela's article discusses nonverbal cues in
a more specific way.
